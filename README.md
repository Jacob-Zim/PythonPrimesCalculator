# PythonPrimesCalculator
Calculates the primes up to a given number using the sieve of Eratosthenes, Sundarum or Atkin (depending on user's choice)
more formally - Given n, generates all prime numbers such that p <= n

Calculating primes is particularly useful in public key cryptography, RSA uses the product of two large primes to encrypt/decrypt data.

extended features would be comparing runtimes and implementing a GUI

note - these algorithms are not heuristic, and are not perfect implementations, but they demonstrate the
general practicality of some of the common prime algorithms
