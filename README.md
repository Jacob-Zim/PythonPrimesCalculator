# PythonPrimesCalculator

Does all sorts of calculations having to do with primes, includes sieves, primality checkers, and a prime factor finder!

To start, run the main.py file in the console

Includes the following algorithms:

    Sieves:
        Atkin
        Eratosthenes
        Sundarum

    Primality:
        Trial Division
        Fermats Little Theorem

    Simple Prime Factors Algorithm

Calculating primes is particularly useful in public key cryptography, RSA uses the product of two large primes to encrypt/decrypt data.

note - these algorithms are not heuristic, and are not perfect implementations, but they demonstrate the
general practicality of some common prime algorithms

Thanks for checking it out, if you have any comments or questions please feel free to send them my way!
