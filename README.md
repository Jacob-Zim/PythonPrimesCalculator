# PythonPrimesCalculator
Calculates the primes up to a given number using the sieve of Eratosthenes, Sundarum or Atkin (depending on user's choice)
more formally - Given n, generates all prime numbers such that p <= n

Calculating primes is particularly useful in public key cryptography, RSA uses the product of two large primes to encrypt/decrypt data.

extended features would be comparing runtimes and implementing a GUI

ToDo: 
 - make a evaluator for primes (returning true / false)
 - make a gui
