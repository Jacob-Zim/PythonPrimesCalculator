# probabilistic based on Fermat's Little Theorem:
# if n is prime, for every A within 1 to n-1,
# A^(n-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod n)
# in other terms, A^(n-1) % n = 1
#
# .00000087412 chance of error, based on the fact that
# there are only 21853 pseudoprimes base 2 that are less than 2.5 * (10**10)

# n is the number to test, k is the iterations of the test where a larger k
# provides a smaller margin of error
